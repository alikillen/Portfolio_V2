# Alison Killen Portfolio Website

## About

Portfolio site version 2 - started over in React!

As part of an assignment during my first term at Coder Academy, in May 2020, I built a (very) simple portfolio website with only HTML and CSS.

After developing my skills with JavaScript and React it's high time to refactor it!

Initially followed along with this [YouTube Tutorial](https://youtu.be/I2UBjN5ER4s) to get started, and I have developed the site from there.

<!-- include features and scope for improvement, tech stack, links to socials etc -->

How to run: npm run start

Todo:

- classnames consistent
- styling methodology consistent
- upgrade react/any modules
- audit npm modules
- implement react-locomotive-scroll? https://blog.logrocket.com/building-react-portfolio-website-locomotive-scroll?
- 90s mode vibes
- resume section like on examples
